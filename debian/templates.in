Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Force extra installation to the EFI removable media path?
 Some EFI-based systems are buggy and do not handle new bootloaders correctly.
 If you force an extra installation of GRUB to the EFI removable media path,
 this should ensure that this system will boot Debian correctly despite such a
 problem. However, it may remove the ability to boot any other operating
 systems that also depend on this path. If so, you will need to make sure that
 GRUB is configured successfully to be able to boot any other OS installations
 correctly.

Template: grub2/update_nvram
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Update NVRAM variables to automatically boot into Debian?
 GRUB can configure your platform's NVRAM variables so that it boots into
 Debian automatically when powered on. However, you may prefer to disable
 this behavior and avoid changes to your boot configuration. For example,
 if your NVRAM variables have been set up such that your system contacts a
 PXE server on every boot, this would preserve that behavior.
