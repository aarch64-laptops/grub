Subject: mkimage: Align efi sections on 4k boundary

There is UEFI firmware popping up in the wild now that implements stricter
permission checks using NX and write protect page table entry bits.

This means that firmware now may fail to load binaries if its individual
sections are not page aligned, as otherwise it can not ensure permission
boundaries.

So let's bump all efi section alignments up to 4k (EFI page size). That way
we will stay compatible going forward.

Unfortunately our internals can't deal very well with a mismatch of alignment
between the virtual and file offsets, so we have to also pad our target
binary a bit.
